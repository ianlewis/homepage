<body>
<p>In javascript functions are not bound. If you pass a function reference to
another function you lose the object the function should be bound to. Two
functions that write repr(this) to the debug window are passed to callLater.</p>
<p>One is passed as is and is called at 3 seconds. It returns [] as it's
representation because "this" is no longer bound.</p> 
<p>The other is called at 6 seconds and prints "this is my repr" to the debug
window because it is wrapped using the Mochikit bind function.<br/>
